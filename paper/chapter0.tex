Twitter is a very active and diverse Microblogging community, with an average of 58 million tweets per day\footnote{\label{fn:twitter-statistics}http://www.statisticbrain.com/twitter-statistics/}. Being able to obtain information only from the most important users offers a great advantage of staying informed and in some cases (e.g. war) it is a matter of life or death.
We propose a model of finding topical authorities on Twitter that computes textual and link analysis features and calculates a weighted mean on the features by which it ranks the top (authoritative) users. Features are easy to understand and the model identifies around 20\% to 45\% of the returned results to actually be influential users.

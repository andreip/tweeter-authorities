                          OT1 + CT1 + RT1
    TS - Topical Signal = ---------------
                             #tweets
         estimates the degree of the author's involvement in the topic

                               OT1
    SS - Signal Strength = -----------
                            OT1 + RT1
         estimates how original is the author; for a true authority
         this should be close to 1.

                                OT1          CT1 - CT2
    nCS - Non-Chat Signal = ----------- + λ -----------
                             OT1 + CT1        CT1 + 1
          λ - is a param that is wanted to be chosen so that:
                    OT1
          nCS < -----------
                 OT1 + CT2

         estimates the degree of conversations that the
         author started ; being higher means he's initiated
         less conversations than others

    RI - Retweet Impact = RT2 log(RT3)
         so penalize greatly when RT3 is small (a small
         number of unique users who repeatedly retweet,
         so that RT2 is big)

    MI - Mention impact = max(M3*log(M4) - M1*log(M2), 0)
         does discard the mentions that ones said
         about the author out of courtesy because author
         said about others too.
         Estimates how much an author is genuinely mentioned.

                          OT4
    HR - Hashtag ratio = -----
                          OT1
         this should keep close to 1 and not diverge too much.
         Helps in avoiding spammers using lots of hashtags.

                              OT2
    LR - Links share ratio = -----
                              OT1

    nSIM - Non-Similarity = 1 - OT3
           This has the role of demoting the users with very high
           similarity score (spammers) and promoting those with
           relatively low OT3.

    URL - Number of URLs posted before any other authors = U
          Uses the metric U directly ; the bigger this score,
          the better, meaning that many URLs have been posted
          by user before any others.
